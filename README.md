# concurrent-programming-final-project
Java, object orientation and concurrency stuff going on, really enjoyful.

After the theorotical part of the Concurrent Programming course in Saarland University, I applied what I learned to practice. 
The quest was to parallelise (or concurrent-ise) the simulationsome covid-like disease's spread. 
The speedups were 3 times for the one-core and around 12 times for multi-core simulation.
